# Hello-World
My very first repository


Hi! My name is Brad, I work at Condominium Associates and I run the help desk. 
I have always loved computers. I got started playing Warcraft 3 on Aol dial-up. 
I went to school for medical assisting when I got out of high school, and hated it. 
It wasn't until a few years later when a string of events led me to the job I have now.
I started working in the mail room and every day I would hear people complain
about normal computer problems. Slowness, internet access, access to network shares, ect.
One day I mustered the courage  to step out of my box with my letters and labels 
and help someone with there computer. I had a drive to do more rewarding work and
knew that I could be of much help in any part of this company. I don't know why
I never thought to delve deeper into computers as a career because I was already a 
nerd and spent most of my free time on the computer. Now it is 2 years later and I am looking to further my career. I plan to
get a few certifications from Microsoft and teach myself how to program. I know 
that I will need a lot of help along the way and I hope I can find support in 
this community!
