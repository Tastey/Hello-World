  Today i created my blog on wordpress to document my progress with learning and outline the process. 
I feel like this is going to help me open up over the internet and express myself to my peers with more confidence. 
I have never written a blog before and it feels really good to get my ideas written down! I am also working on my 
spelling and grammer at the same time!
